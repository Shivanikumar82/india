                            <h2> Religion should not have influence or be involved in the organization of society, education, government, etc.</h2>
							<h3>We live in a society where numerous individuals coexist and each of these individuals is unique. They differ in terms of their color, culture, religion and caste, leading to social stratification based on various factors. Among these individuals, there are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and others. When people from diverse religious backgrounds live together in peace, harmony and with mutual love, while respecting each other's religions, it reflects the essence of secularism.</h3>

                            <h3>India has been a secular state since gaining independence in 1947. The principles of secularism were enshrined in the constitution of India. Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, played a significant role in establishing and promoting secular values in the country's modern history.<br>

                                The Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India, enacted in 1976, reinforced India's secular identity. The Preamble to the Constitution explicitly declares India as a secular nation. According to the Constitution, there is no official state religion in India. Furthermore, schools that are fully owned by the state are not allowed to promote religious instruction (as stated in Article 28) and taxpayer funds cannot be utilized to support any particular religion (as stated in Article 27). These constitutional provisions reflect India's commitment to maintaining a secular society.</h3><br>

<div class="campus-content">
    <h3>According to P.B. Gajendragarkar, a former Chief Justice of India, secularism is defined as follows: "The state does not owe loyalty to any particular religion; as such, it is not irreligious or anti-religious. It gives equal freedom to all religions." In this definition, secularism emphasizes the impartiality of the state towards all religious beliefs and ensures that no particular religion receives preferential treatment or dominance in the affairs of the nation. Instead, it upholds the principle of granting equal freedom and respect to all religions, allowing individuals to practice their faith without discrimination.</h3>
